Sandbox Snapdragon
==================

Code snippets, etc., from our work building clusters with the [Inforce ICF6410](http://www.inforcecomputing.com/product/moreinfo/ifc6410.html), which is driven by the [Qualcomm Snapdragon](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon) 600.

An initial [HPL](http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/) benchmark measured 1.7 GFLOPS of performance, and a basic run of [iperf](http://code.google.com/p/iperf/) with 4 streams over the 1 GbE interface showed just over 900 Mbps.
